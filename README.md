Demonstration of how to store stock data and 'trade' on it

This will be a small demonstration on how to use the Bloomberg API to access stock market data.
Then we will store it in a pandas dataframe, then you can process this data (not in live time, so complex calculations are not latency-dependent) and apply your own trading strategy, and reap a fake profit.
